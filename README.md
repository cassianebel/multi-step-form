# A Multi-Step Form
Just a multi-step registration form for an imaginary conference. https://cassianebel.github.io/multi-step-form/

## Features
- The form is divided into 4 separate 'pages' to keep the cognitive load low for the user.
- Input validation on required fields, with helpful error messages.
- Auto-focus on the first input of each page load.
- Dynamic fields that show/hide or disable options based on user's input on related fields.
- Progress bar to let the user know how far they've come and how much of the form is left to fill out.
- Animated page transitions.
